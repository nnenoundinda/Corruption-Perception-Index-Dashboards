# Corruption and Development Analysis (2012–2023)

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between perceived corruption and development outcomes across countries, regions, and U.S. states. It uses Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) data to visualize trends in education, poverty, and income inequality through interactive Tableau dashboards.

## Data Sources
- Transparency International – Corruption Perceptions Index (2012–2023)
- U.S. Census Bureau – American Community Survey (ACS)
  - Poverty (S1701)
  - Educational Attainment (S1501)
  - Income Inequality / Gini Index (B19083)
  - Population (B01003)

## Tools Used
- Tableau
- Tableau Prep

## Dashboards
The project consists of three main dashboards:
1. **Global CPI Dashboard** – World map and time-series trends of corruption perception.
2. **Regional Comparison Dashboard** – Regional rankings and country-level comparisons.
3. **U.S. State-Level Dashboard** – Maps and scatter plots comparing education, poverty, and inequality.

## Key Findings
- Regions with lower perceived corruption tend to show stronger development outcomes.
- Corruption perceptions change slowly over time, with small shifts during major events such as COVID-19.
- In the U.S., higher education levels are generally associated with lower poverty but sometimes higher income inequality.
- Results demonstrate correlation, not causation.
